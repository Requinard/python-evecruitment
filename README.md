#EVEcruitment

EVEcruitment is a small, lightweight python script to help you get the most out of recruiting.

It scrapes the chatlogs and looks for any sentences of interest. As soon as they are triggered, your computer will make a beep, and the appriopriate character name will be copied to your clipboard.

##Customize it

* Set channel_name to the channel you want to scrape
* Set the sentences_of_interest to a list of any sentences you intend to scrape
* If you set your eve chatlogs to a different location then your home directory, make sure to change folder to accomodate that change.
** If you're wondering if this applies to you, it will be, by definition, not applicable to you
